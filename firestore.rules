/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for QuizMaster application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where users have full control over their own data (quizzes, questions, and attempts) and cannot access data owned by other users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically under `/users/{userId}`, with subcollections for quizzes, questions, and quiz attempts.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles (created via Firebase Authentication).
 * - /users/{userId}/quizzes/{quizId}: Quizzes created by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizzes/{quizId}/questions/{questionId}: Questions within a specific quiz.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizAttempts/{quizAttemptId}: Quiz attempts made by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete quizzes, questions, and attempts under their own user ID.
 * - Listing quizzes and quiz attempts is scoped to the user, preventing unauthorized access to other users' data.
 * - Data consistency is enforced by validating the userId in the path against the document's internal creatorId.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The Firestore structure denormalizes the `creatorId` (or `userId`) into the document path itself (e.g., `/users/{userId}/quizzes/{quizId}`), eliminating the need for `get()` calls to verify ownership.
